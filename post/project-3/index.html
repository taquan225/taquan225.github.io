<h3 id="graph-information">Graph Information</h3>
<h4 id="graph-1-total-amount-of-money-spend-on-transfer-in-euros">Graph 1: Total Amount of Money spend on Transfer (in Euros)</h4>
<p>This graph consists of two bar charts; the upper graph represents the total amount of money spent on transfers by seasons, and the lower graph depicts the same information by leagues and transfers windows. Both graphs share the same unit of Euros.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-1.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the upper graph, the color represents the leagues that are included in spending money on the transfers market. The bars represent the seasons when the transfer takes place.</li>
<li>In the lower graph, the color represents the time windows that the transfers happened. The bars represent the leagues that the players joined.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: From this graph, it is clear to see that the amount spent on the transfer market increases after each year. English Premier League (EPL) teams contributed almost half of the total amounts spent on transfers, with over five billion Euros spent in ten years.</p>
<h4 id="graph-2-number-of-transfers-happened-from-2007-to-2017">Graph 2: Number of Transfers happened from 2007 to 2017</h4>
<p>This graph consists of two bar charts; the upper graph represents the number of transfers by seasons, and the lower graph depicts the same information by leagues and transfer windows.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-2.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the upper graph, the color represents the types of transfers. The bars represent the seasons when the transfer takes place.</li>
<li>In the lower graph, the color represents the time windows that the transfers happened. The bars represent the leagues that the players joined.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: From this graph, it is clear to see that the amount spent on the transfer market is on an increasing trend. However, the trend is not clear. In some years, the number of transfers is less than their previous season. Italy’s highest division (Serie A) teams contributed the most number of transfers out of the five leagues. Another interesting finding is that EPL teams had players joining them in the pre-season.</p>
<h4 id="graph-3-top-10-teams-transferring-out-and-acquiring-the-most-players-from-2007-to-2017">Graph 3: Top 10 Teams transferring out and acquiring the Most Players from 2007 to 2017</h4>
<p>This graph consists of two bar charts; the upper graph represents the 10 teams transferring the most players out of their squads, and the lower graph depicts the 10 teams acquiring the most players from the market.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-3.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In both graphs, the color represents the types of transfers. The bars represent the teams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: From this graph, we can see that all top 10 teams transferring out players on loan. It is fascinating information. These teams may loan out their players to reduce their salary budget and allow their youngsters to have more game times. About the acquiring part, most of the transfers are sold. The exception is Udinese, as all of their transfers are undisclosed.</p>
<h4 id="graph-4-top-10-teams-spending-the-most-money-on-transfers-from-2007-to-2017-in-euros">Graph 4: Top 10 Teams spending the most money on Transfers from 2007 to 2017 (in Euros)</h4>
<p>This graph consists of one bar chart. This bar chart represents the 10 teams that spent the most money on the transfer markets from 2007 to 2017.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-4.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The unit of this graph used in this graph is Euros.</li>
<li>The color in the graph represents the positions of the transferred players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: From this graph, we can conclude that most teams do not spend money on buying goalkeepers. Instead, they used most of their money on midfielders and attackers.</p>
<h4 id="graph-5-top-10-players-with-highest-total-transfer-fee-from-2007-to-2017-in-euros">Graph 5: Top 10 Players with Highest Total Transfer Fee from 2007 to 2017 (in Euros)</h4>
<p>This graph consists of one bar chart. This bar chart represents the 10 players that had the highest total transfer fees from 2007 to 2017. The unit of this graph used in this graph is Euros.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-5.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The color in the graph represents the positions of the transferred players.</li>
<li>The bar represents the player’s name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>: From this graph, we see that five out of the top ten players are midfielders. In the meanwhile, four of the top ten players are attackers. Only one player on this list is a defender. It shows that teams prioritized their budgets on midfielders and attackers.</p>
<h4 id="graph-6-all-transfers-made-in-seasons-from-2007-to-2017">Graph 6: All Transfers made in Seasons from 2007 to 2017</h4>
<p>This graph consists of a set of box plots. Each box plot represents all transfer happen in one season. Therefore, there are ten box plots in this set.
<figure><img src="https://taquan225.github.io/images/project-3-6.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each data point represents a player transfer.</li>
<li>The y-axis represents the transfer fee of the player, and the x-axis indicates the season when the transfer happens.</li>
<li>The color represents the league the player joined in that transfer.</li>
</ul>
